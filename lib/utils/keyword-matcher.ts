/**
 * Keyword Matcher
 *
 * Matches comment text against a set of keywords with support for:
 * - Case-insensitive matching
 * - Whole-word or partial matching
 * - Multi-keyword OR logic (any match = true)
 * - Emoji and special character stripping
 *
 * Unicode note: the original implementation used ASCII `\w` and `\b`, which
 * treat every Cyrillic / CJK / accented letter as a "special character" and a
 * non-word char. That silently deleted all non-Latin comment text before
 * matching, so a Russian keyword like "Клод" could never match. Everything
 * here uses Unicode property escapes (`\p{L}` letters, `\p{N}` numbers) with the
 * `u` flag so non-Latin scripts work.
 *
 * Diacritics note: `\p{L}` keeps accented letters intact, which is correct, but
 * it means "PREÇO" and "preco" stay different strings and never match each
 * other. Commenters type accents inconsistently and keyboards differ, so a
 * Portuguese or Spanish campaign keyed on "preco" silently misses every
 * commenter who typed "preço", and vice versa. `foldDiacritics` closes that
 * gap on BOTH sides of the comparison.

 * Canonicalise Arabic-script text (Persian, Arabic, Urdu) before matching.

 * not: the letter variants below are the *same letter* typed on a different
 * keyboard, and harakat are optional vocalisation almost nobody types. Without
 * this step an Iranian account keyed on "لینک" misses every commenter whose
 * phone sends the Arabic yeh and kaf (U+064A / U+0643) instead of the Persian
 * ones (U+06CC / U+06A9) — the two strings look identical on screen and never
